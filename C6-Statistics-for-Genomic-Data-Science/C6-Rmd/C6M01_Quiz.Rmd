# Question 3: Create a SummarizedExperiment object
data(sample.ExpressionSet, package = "Biobase")
se = makeSummarizedExperimentFromExpressionSet(sample.ExpressionSet)

# Question 2: Set up caching (use eval=TRUE in R Markdown context)
#The plot is random the first time you knit the document. It is identical to the first time the second time you knit the document. After removing the folders test_cache and test_files they generate new random versions.
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache = TRUE)

# Question 3: Generate a random plot
x = rnorm(10)
plot(x, pch = 19, col = "dodgerblue")

y = rbinom(20, size = 1, prob = 0.5)

# Question 5: Load Bottomly and Bodymap data sets
#Just considering the phenotype data what are some reasons that the Bottomly data set is likely a better experimental design than the Bodymap data? Imagine the question of interest in the Bottomly data is to compare strains and in the Bodymap data it is to compare tissues.
#The Bottomly data has biological replicates for each group but the Bodymap data does not.

close(con)
bm = bodymap.eset
pdata_bm = pData(bm)

# Question 6: Pie chart for technical replicates by tissue
# What are some reasons why this plot is not useful for comparing the number of technical replicates by tissue (you may need to install the plotrix package).
#The "mixture" category is split across multiple wedges. 
pie3D(pdata_bm$num.tech.reps, labels = pdata_bm$tissue.type)

# Question 7: Heatmap of 500 most highly expressed genes
# Which of the following code chunks will make a heatmap of the 500 most highly expressed genes (as defined by total count), without re-ordering due to clustering? Are the highly expressed samples next to each other in sample order?
# No they are not next to each other.

# Load the dataset and define edata

# Perform operations on edata
row_sums = rowSums(edata)
index = which(rank(-row_sums) < 500)
heatmap(edata[index, ], Rowv = NA, Colv = NA)

# Question 8: Load Bodymap data
# Make an MA-plot of the first sample versus the second sample using the log2 transform (hint: you may have to add 1 first) and the rlog transform from the DESeq2 package. How are the two MA-plots different? Which kind of genes appear most different in each plot?
# The plots look pretty similar, but the rlog transform seems to shrink the low abundance genes more. In both cases, the genes in the middle of the expression distribution show the biggest differences.

# Question 9: Load Montgomery and Pickrell data set (part 1)
# Cluster the data in three ways:
# 1. With no changes to the data
# 2. After filtering all genes with rowMeans less than 100
# 3. After taking the log2 transform of the data without filtering
# Color the samples by which study they came from (Hint: consider using the function myplclust.R in the package  rafalib available from CRAN and looking at the argument  lab.col.)

# Clustering with or without filtering is about the same. Clustering after the log2 transform shows better clustering with respect to the study variable. The likely reason is that the highly skewed distribution doesn't match the Euclidean distance metric being used in the clustering example.

# 2.Prepare Data for Plotting Compute the log2 transform and add 1 to avoid log of zero:
log2_data = log2(edata + 1)
# Compute the rlog transform using the DESeq2 package:
if (!requireNamespace("DESeq2", quietly = TRUE)) 
    BiocManager::install("DESeq2")
library(DESeq2)

dds = DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = round(edata), colData = pdata, design = ~1)
rlog_data = rlog(dds)
# Generate MA-Plots Create MA-plots for the first sample vs. the second sample for both transformations:
# Log2 transform MA-plot
A = (log2_data[, 1] + log2_data[, 2]) / 2
M = log2_data[, 1] - log2_data[, 2]
plot(A, M, pch = 20, col = "blue", xlab = "A (Average)", ylab = "M (Difference)", main = "Log2 Transform")

# rlog transform MA-plot
rlog_mat = assay(rlog_data)
A_rlog = (rlog_mat[, 1] + rlog_mat[, 2]) / 2
M_rlog = rlog_mat[, 1] - rlog_mat[, 2]
plot(A_rlog, M_rlog, pch = 20, col = "red", xlab = "A (Average)", ylab = "M (Difference)", main = "rlog Transform")


# Question 10: Load Montgomery and Pickrell data set (part 2)
# Cluster the samples using k-means clustering after applying the log2 transform (be sure to add 1). Set a seed for reproducible results (use set.seed(1235)). If you choose two clusters, do you get the same two clusters as you get if you use the cutree function to cluster the samples into two groups? Which cluster matches most closely to the study labels?
# They produce different answers, with hierarchical clustering giving a much more unbalanced clustering. The k-means clustering matches study better.
